## Demo
To demo this project, go to `https://playing-cards-backend.herokuapp.com/`. To test the RestAPI response (for example to test with 9 players), go to `https://playing-cards-backend.herokuapp.com/deal?number=9`. You can change `9` to any number.

* Since I'm using free version of Heroku, the processing speed might be slow or sometimes stopped.
